<p>Markdown is awesome. It is awesome &lsquo;cause it provides a universal interface to write anything and store &rsquo;em up. However, it&rsquo;s been a frustration for me being unable to embed <a href="https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html">bokeh</a> plots in markdown. Compared with static images, interactive plots is way more condensed in information and can sometimes save a real lot of time. Apparently, by the time I wrote this post, I&rsquo;ve already figured out a way to embed this kind of plots in my blog, but the question is: how does it work?</p>
<p>In fact, bokeh has already provided a function to prepare everything you need. The function <code>components</code> in the [bokeh.embed]((<a href="https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/reference/embed.html">https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/reference/embed.html</a>) library returns the two parts that you&rsquo;ll need to copy and paste into the makrdown file (aka. the post). Step by step:</p>
<ol>
<li>Plot with bokeh, scale layout with the <code>gridplot</code> function specifying <code>sizing_mode</code> as <code>scale_width</code>. Say our final layout object is called <code>layout</code>.</li>
<li>Pass <code>layout</code> to the <code>components</code> function, parse returned values into <code>script</code> and <code>div</code>.</li>
<li>Copy (you may use packages like <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyperclip/">pyperclip</a>) and paste the head scripts (see below), <code>script</code> and <code>div</code> into the markdown file.</li>
</ol>
<p>Head scripts (they are actually not always required, but considering ease of use I suggest copying them anyway):</p>
