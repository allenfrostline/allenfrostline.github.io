      <description>The last two stops of our Christmas journal, Zagreb the capital, and Dubrovnik a small but ancient town, in Croatia. Zagreb didn&amp;rsquo;t left me much memory &amp;ndash; except for the vivid, various graffiti all throughout the whole city. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit funny when we say a Yao Ming on the wall when pulling our luggage to the airport. Yao is definately within China&amp;rsquo;s top ten most valuable icons worldwide, especially in the expression package sense.</description>

      <description>We arrived in Budapest two days ago. It was a larger, more modern city split by the large Danube into Buda and Pest. We visited the magnificent Parliament building &amp;ndash; indeed it was magnificent, yet maybe bacause of the poor English of the guide or the seemingly too many museums, I felt kinda tired about all the decorations inside it. We all looked tired. It was a nice little cafe for yesterday&amp;rsquo;s dinner.</description>

      <description>Yesterday arrived us in Bratislava, Slovak. It was yet another small but historic city. The weather was getting colder. The sleet floated along the roads, which is kinda psychedemic, actually.
The day before, we were in Wien, Austria. And further before were us in Hallstatt, which is also an Austria town at the foot of the Alps.
Time to leave.</description>

      <title>Christmas across Eastern Europe (1): Czech Republic</title>

      <description>The lifestyle in Czech Republic is far different from that in the Netherlands. The small, shabby shops near our accommodation, the depressions here and there along the quiet lanes towards Vysehrad (a castle of 10 min&amp;rsquo;s walk from our place), the queues of cars parking alongside the road seemingly with no end at all - those images arouse me of a place not so &amp;ldquo;Europa&amp;rdquo;, a place named after water,</description>
