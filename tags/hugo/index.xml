      <description>My website&amp;rsquo;s backend has recently migrated from Hexo to Hugo. The former was written in Node.js and suffered severely from compiling huge files. The latter, on the other hand, is a golang-based static site generator and thanks to that I now only need to wait &amp;lt;2 seconds before a complete rebuild, despite my increasing number of posts. I have no intend to generate another piece Internet garbage repeating what I actually did during the migration.</description>
