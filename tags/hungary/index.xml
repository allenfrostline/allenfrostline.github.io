      <description>We arrived in Budapest two days ago. It was a larger, more modern city split by the large Danube into Buda and Pest. We visited the magnificent Parliament building &amp;ndash; indeed it was magnificent, yet maybe bacause of the poor English of the guide or the seemingly too many museums, I felt kinda tired about all the decorations inside it. We all looked tired. It was a nice little cafe for yesterday&amp;rsquo;s dinner.</description>
