      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the well-developed NexT theme for this Hexo blog since I built it. The old theme was fantastic, with a broad header, strong local search, neat, animated two-column layout and various comment systems including valine1 and gitment2. However, it&amp;rsquo;s a two-edged sword to have so many features binded, and more importantly, presented right within such a simple layout. Eventually, I realized that I actually don&amp;rsquo;t need the spacious header or the animated sidebar (I do, though, need local search, and we&amp;rsquo;ll return to that below).</description>
