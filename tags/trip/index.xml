This time we went to Fairbanks, Alaska, for Aurora and also, for another Arctic experience.</description>

      <description>These are the photos I took during our impromptu trip in Northern Europe. We started from Oslo, the capital of Norway and headed all the way to the Abisko National Park in Sweden, which was my first time stepping inside the Arctic Circle.</description>
