      <description>Yesterday arrived us in Bratislava, Slovak. It was yet another small but historic city. The weather was getting colder. The sleet floated along the roads, which is kinda psychedemic, actually.
The day before, we were in Wien, Austria. And further before were us in Hallstatt, which is also an Austria town at the foot of the Alps.
Time to leave.</description>
