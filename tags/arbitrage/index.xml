      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been months since my last update on cryptocurrency arbitrage strategies. The original version has been completely driven off the market and thus I decided to develop a new one. The market is primitive and savage in many senses, by which I mean there&amp;rsquo;re supposed to be a bunch of inefficiency and corresponding arbitrage opportunities.
On the top of the page is the backtest PnL of the new strategy 4 from 01/01 up to yesterday, 07/26.</description>

Update April 11:
Strategy offline before I realized my AWS bills was being owed and the server down due to that&amp;hellip; Performance excl. and incl. loss due to holding costs and enforcing execution, etc.</description>

      <description>Coinbase has just launched BCH as an alternative to BTC because of the high transaction fees and annoying delays of the latter one. As a result, the exchange rate of USD/BCH rocketed tenfolds within 24 hours. Together with BTC, mainstream altcoins like ETH and ETC faced significant slump since a week ago. On contrary, XRP, because of the rumored endorcement from big companies like Amazon, is experiencing a straight appreciation of almost 100% since two weeks ago.</description>
