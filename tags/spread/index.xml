      <description>In this strategy we try to do spread trading based on the M-day (adjusted) returns of two highly related ETFs (exchange-traded funds). The intuition is to hedge the one-sided risks of buy-and-holding one specific ETF with (in expectation) increasing returns, by holding an opposite position of another ETF with decreasing returns. Once we have that the two ETFs&amp;rsquo; returns are highly correlated, we can trade and make profit by this sort of pair trading.</description>
