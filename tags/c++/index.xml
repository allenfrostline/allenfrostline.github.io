      <description>This is the first post of my ambitious plan trying to enumerate as many key points about the C++ language as I can. These notes are only for personal reviewing purposes and shall definitely be used commercially by anyone interested. Comment below for any missing C++ syntax or features. üëçüèª
Header Basically there&amp;rsquo;re only one thing that needs attention. For standard libraries we use &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; and for local libraries we use quotes.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a die-hard fan of Sublime Text (ST), all the time from the 2nd to the 3rd version now. To be frank, I use ST in almost all situations: taking lecture notes in LaTeX, drafting small projects in Python or R (while for large projects, Jupyter Notebook and RStudio are stronger platforms), or tracking my Todo-list in Markdown. Everything works so smoothly and lightly with ST, especially compared with IDEs like Xcode or Visual Studio.</description>
